# Project Outline
The theme of this project was to create an API that scraps the latest diseases outbreak reports from the World Health Organisation and then use it in a meaningful way by creating our own website.

Both the website & the API are hosted on Firebase.

The API was written in Python and the website was written using ReactJS.

Website link: https://diseasesovertime.com/

Website features:
* Visually display a variety of diseases and the amount of people they have infected or killed within since 1996
* Provides a coronavirus tracking system for Australians infected by coronavirus to provide their details
	* Completed before the COVIDSafe app existed 
	* A lot less invasive than the COVIDSafe app
* A coronavirus simulator which will visually display the how COVID can spread in Australia based on the data from John Hopkins Coronavirus API
	* Visually expresses the impact of an uncontrolled virus
	* Visually shows the effects of a lockdown
	* Visually indicates how effective a vaccine can be
	* Note it can only handle showing up to 30,000 cases
