Front Page = Map
---------------------
Map should have a filter to discern which disease you want the map to show information for
Map should have a slider to go from Earliest date (not sure when) to 1 year in the future - not sure if this should be yearly

Clicking on a continent's name will redirect the user to the continent's page
Underneath the continent's name should be (in full):
- Continent name
- Total number of reports/cases
- % of population infected
- % of infected dead or % of population dead (not sure which is better)

A continent should become more redder as the % of people who are infected increase and vice versa
A continent should become more black as the % of mortality increases and vice versa


Continent Page
---------------------
Shows a breakdown of all countries underneath their respective continent
Clicking on a continent or country will lead the user to that page

Continent/Country page should list all reports from our database
Continent/Country page should have a graphs for % infected/ % dead and maybe a word graph for most commonly associated words across all reports in relation to this country
