The cases were diagnosed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 6 February and microbiological characterization identified the cases as serotype 2 (DENV 2 by PCR). Laboratory confirmation was performed at the national reference laboratory of the Chile Institute of Public Health on 6 February 2020. \n\nThese are the first confirmed cases of dengue due to DENV 2 reported on Easter Island in 2020. The cases are females with ages ranging from 27 to 49 years. The dates of symptom onset were between 27 January to 6 February 2020. None of the cases reported any travel history.\n\nIn 2000, the presence of the vector, A. aegypti, was confirmed on Easter Island. The first dengue outbreak was reported in 2002 and was due to DENV 1. In 2009, two autochthonous DENV 4 cases were detected and in 2016, 2017 and 2018, cases due to DENV 1 were reported (33, 2 and 18 cases, respectively). In 2019, a total of 38 dengue cases were reported on Easter Island (28 autochthonous DENV 1 cases, nine imported cases from Tahiti (four DENV 1 and five DENV 2 cases), and one probable autochthonous DENV 1 case). No severe dengue cases were reported in 2019.\n\nSince 2009, no other serotypes besides DENV 1 have been identified in autochthonous cases until the beginning of 2020.\n\nThe density of competent vectors on Easter Island could potentially contribute to the spread of the disease throughout the island.\nPublic health response \n\nActions implemented by local public health authorities are as follows:\n\nStrengthening active and passive epidemiological surveillance, including syndromic surveillance.\nStrengthening and intensifying vector surveillance and control.\nProviding training to healthcare professionals on early detection of warning signs of severe disease and appropriate clinical management of patients with dengue.\nImplementing a risk communication strategy for local awareness.\n\nWHO risk assessment\n\nDengue fever is a febrile illness that affects infants, young children, and adults, with symptoms ranging from mild fever to high fever, with headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and rash. It is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of the four dengue virus serotypes.\n\nThe introduction of serotype DENV 2 into this population, majority of which already have primary infection with DENV 1, can pose a potential risk for severe dengue cases due to secondary infections.\n\nEaster Island has a subtropical climate. The average annual temperature is 20.5°C with small variations between seasons that do not usually exceed 7°C.  Summer runs from 21 December to 21 March, with January and February being the warmest months with an average maximum temperature of 28°C and minimum temperature of 15°C.\n\nEaster Island has weekly air transport connections with French Polynesia, where there is an ongoing dengue outbreak with predominantly DENV 2. Additionally, due to the presence of the competent vector and, given that Easter Island is a popular tourist destination, the risk of spread to neighboring islands and countries cannot be ruled out.\nWHO advice\n\nIn light of the increase in dengue cases and possible severe dengue cases in several countries and territories of the Region of the Americas especially in 2019, PAHO/WHO encourages Member States to follow the key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management (IVM) as published in the 21 November 2018 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Alert on Dengue and the 11 November 2019 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on Dengue.\r\n\n\nThere is no specific treatment for dengue; however, the timely detection of cases, identifying any warning signs of severe dengue, and appropriate case management are key elements of care to prevent patient deaths due to dengue. A delay in seeking medical care in severe dengue cases is often related to deaths from dengue virus disease.\n\nAdditionally, IVM activities should be enhanced to remove potential breeding sites, reduce vector populations, and minimize individual exposure. This should include both larval and adult vector control strategies (i.e. environmental management and source reduction and chemical control measures). Vector control measures should be implemented at households, places of work, schools, and healthcare facilities, among others, to prevent the vector-person contact.\n\nGiven that Aedes mosquitoes, the competent vector, have greater activity during the day, personal protection measures are recommended such as the use of protective clothing that minimizes skin exposure and repellents that can be applied to exposed skin or clothes; the use of repellents must be in strict accordance with the label instructions. Window and door screens, and mosquito nets (impregnated or not with insecticide), can be useful to reduce the vector-person contact in closed spaces during the day or night. Community supported source reduction measures should be initiated, and vector surveillance and control implemented.\n\nFor more information, please see the following links:\n\n\nPan American Health Organization / World Health Organization.

In January 2020, health authorities in the region declared a dengue epidemic in Guadeloupe and Saint-Martin and indicated that Martinique is also at-risk of an epidemic.\n\nDengue epidemics in these territories usually occur when there is a shift in the predominant circulating DENV serotype, and non-immune populations (e.g., tourists, new immigrants, or people not previously exposed to the circulating serotypes) are exposed to the new serotype through human movements within the territories or across neighboring countries. Local transmission occurs through the Aedes  mosquito vector present on the islands and in French Guiana.\nFrench Guiana\n\nFrom January 2019 through 17 February 2020, a total of 487 confirmed cases of dengue, with no severe cases or deaths, was reported (Figure 1). The most affected communes were Kourou, on the coastline, with 225 confirmed cases, and Maripasoula, in the south-eastern part of French Guiana with 55 confirmed cases. Except during 2017 and 2018, dengue cases have been reported every year, with the most recent largest outbreak reported in 2013, resulting in 13,240 suspected cases including 6 deaths.\n\nLaboratory tests identified DENV-1 and DENV -2 as the predominant serotypes circulating in 2019 and 2020 (as at February 17, 2020). So far in 2020, DENV-2 has accounted for 63% of reported cases. \nFigure 1.

Of these, more than 1,200 were confirmed by the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) antigen test and/or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Forty-three percent (n = 2,540) of the total number of cases were reported since the beginning of January 2020 (Figure 2).\n\nFrom 19 January through 16 February 2020, clinically diagnosed cases were reported in 14 of the 24 communes with a sentinel general practitioner (out of a total of 32 communes that make up the archipelago). Most of the cases were reported in the following communes: Basse-Terre, Le Gosier, Le Moule, Petit-Canal, Petit-Bourg, Pointe-Noire, and Saint-François and the isle of Marie-Galante (eastern and central part of the main island). The most recent largest outbreak reported in Guadeloupe was in 2013, with 12,706 suspected cases including 8 deaths. \n\nBetween 2005 and 2010, the predominant circulating serotypes were DENV-4 (2005), DENV-2 (2006 and 2007) and DENV-1 (2008 and 2010). In 2019, laboratory tests identified DENV-2 as the predominant dengue serotype, which is currently circulating and has been reported in all of the affected areas.\nFigure 2.

Forty-seven percent of the suspected cases (n = 1,155) were reported since the beginning of January 2020. From 19 January through 15 February 2020, confirmed cases were reported in 18 of the 34 communes of the island. The most affected parts of the island are in the South and Central of Martinique. Results of laboratory tests indicate that DENV-2 and DENV-3 are the predominant serotypes currently circulating.\n\nIn 2018, Martinique did not report any confirmed cases. The last outbreak reported in Martinique was from 2013 to 2015 with 7,040 suspected cases and no deaths reported. The outbreak was due to DENV-1 which was the predominant circulating serotype. \nFigure 3.

Results of laboratory tests indicate that serotypes DENV-1 and DENV-3 are currently circulating, with predominance of DENV-1.\n\nFrom 2002 through 2005, DENV-3 was the only serotype in circulation. Between 2006 and 2010, the predominant circulating serotypes were DENV-2 (2006, 2009) and DENV-1 (2007, 2008 and 2010) with co-circulation of DENV-3 and DENV-4. In 2013 and 2014, DENV-4 was the predominant serotype.\nSaint-Barthélemy\n\nFrom December 2019 through 15 February 2020, a total of 100 suspected cases of dengue, including 20 cases confirmed by NS1 antigen test and/or RT-PCR, was reported (Figure 4). Laboratory tests identified DENV-1 and DENV-2 as the circulating serotypes.\n\nThe last outbreak reported in Saint-Barthélemy was from 2013 to 2014 with 970 suspected cases and one death reported. The outbreak was due to DENV-4 which was the predominant circulating serotype; with co-circulation of DENV-2. DENV-1 was identified during the 2009/2010 outbreak.\nFigure 4.

There are two main seasons: a wet season from June to November and a dry season from December to May.\n\nFrench Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthélemy have been reporting dengue cases throughout 2020; however, an increase was observed towards the end of 2019.\n\nIn Guadeloupe and Martinique, cases have exceeded the seasonal threshold since October and November 2019, respectively. \n\nA shift in the predominant DENV serotype in these territories may result in more severe secondary dengue virus infections and may require comprehensive risk communications. Due to the presence of the competent vector and, given that these territories are popular tourist destinations, the risk of spread to neighboring islands and other countries cannot be ruled out.\nWHO advice \n\nIn light of the increase in dengue cases and severe dengue cases in several countries and territories of the Region of the Americas, especially in 2019, the Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) encourages Member States to follow key recommendations regarding outbreak preparedness and response, case management, laboratory, and integrated vector management (IVM).

The confirmed cases in this week were reported from eight health areas in four health zones: Mabalako (62%, n=18), Butembo (14%, n=4), Kalunguta (17%, n=5), and Katwa (7%, n=2). Three of the four cases reported in Butembo in the past 14 days are linked to a transmission chain of more than 50 people that originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone. One individual classified as a relapse case of EVD, infected several other individuals within the family and through nosocomial transmission (for more information, please see the disease outbreak news published on 19 December 2019). In Kalunguta Health Zone, the five cases reported between 24 and 28 December 2019, are a distinct epidemiologically linked chain of transmission, although the source of exposure is currently under investigation.\n\nIn the past 21 days (11 December to 31 December), 40 confirmed cases were reported from 10 health areas within five neighbouring active health zones in North Kivu province (Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (68%, n=27), Butembo (13%, n=5), Kalunguta (13%, n=5), Katwa (5%, n=2), and Biena (3%, n=1).

The confirmed cases were reported from Mabalako (64%, n=9), Beni (29%, n=4) and Musienene (7%, n=1) Health Zones in North Kivu Province. All new confirmed cases (100%, 14/14) reported in the past seven days were registered contacts prior to symptom onset and had epidemiological links to the transmission chain which originated from Aloya Health Area in Mabalako Health Zone.\n\nIn the past 21 days (25 December 2019 to 14 January 2020), 40 confirmed cases were reported from 14 health areas within seven active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Mabalako (43%, n=17), Butembo (20%, n=8), Beni (13%, n=5), Mambasa (10%, n=4), Kalunguta (8%, n=3), Katwa (5%, n=2), and Musienene (3%, n=1). Mabalako Health Zone remains the current hotspot of the outbreak, having reported 43% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days. The majority of cases (88%, 35/40) reported from this period are linked to known chains of transmission, which is similar to the period from 4 to 24 December 2019 (89%, 47/53). In the past 21 days, 8% (3/36) of the confirmed EVD deaths were people who died in the community, outside of Ebola treatment centres. From these three community deaths, 15 additional cases occurred, which reinforces the need for continued activities to follow contacts, detect symptomatic patients as early as possible, and engage communities in response efforts. \n\nAs of 14 January, a total of 3406 EVD cases were reported, including 3288 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2236 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1910) were female, 28% (n=960) were children aged less than 18 years, and 169 (5% of all reported cases) were health care workers. \n\nIn the coming week, there will be nine health zones in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces that will have contacts in or entering their high-risk period (seven to 13 days after last exposure to the virus). In Kalunguta Health Zone, North Kivu Province, where five individuals were confirmed with EVD from 24 to 28 December 2019, all 153 contacts have cleared their 21-day follow-up, with no new cases reported. In Mambasa Health Zone, Ituri Province, where four new cases were reported from 4 to 5 January 2020, more than 400 followed contacts are nearing the end of their high-risk period. \n\nIt has been more than 17 months since the outbreak was first declared on 1 August 2018. The number of cases reported per week is lower than the period from March to September 2019 (Figure 1). However, there are several health areas which are difficult to reach due to insecurity, including Mandima Health Zone, where there are rumours of several community deaths in Lwemba Health Area. Continued response efforts in active health zones, including in insecure areas, and preventing reintroduction of the disease into health zones with dense populations which have previously been cleared are crucial to ending ongoing transmission.\nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

All of the cases were reported from Beni Health Zone in North Kivu Province. Eight of the cases (8/9) were registered contacts prior to symptom onset; all nine had epidemiological links to a confirmed case. \n\nIn the past 21 days (1 to 21 January 2020), 35 confirmed cases were reported from 11 health areas within five active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=14), Mabalako (n=11), Butembo (n=5), Mambasa (n=4), and Musienene (n=1). Beni and Mabalako Health Zones remain the current hotspots of the outbreak, having reported 71% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days. Of the 35 people confirmed with EVD in the past 21 days, 24 were isolated and provided care within the first two days after the onset of symptoms, meaning they have better chances of survival and are less likely to infect contacts in the community. In the past 21 days, only one confirmed EVD death occurred in the community, outside of an Ebola treatment centre.\n\nIn recent weeks, contacts of confirmed cases have been offered the option of staying in supportive accommodation allocated for identified EVD contacts where they are provided with food and other essential goods. This allows for systematic daily follow-up of contacts and enables prompt isolation and provision of care to contacts that become symptomatic. As a result, the median time to isolation in the past 21 days has decreased from three days to one day (interquartile range 0-3). \n\nThe number of new confirmed cases reported each week has remained stable over the past six weeks, with approximately 14 new EVD cases reported weekly. In addition, improved surveillance indicators such as the proportion of cases listed as contacts and followed prior to detection, and the decreased time to isolation of cases are encouraging signs. \n\nAs of 21 January, a total of 3416 EVD cases were reported, including 3297 confirmed and 119 probable cases, of which 2238 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1912) were female, 28% (n=963) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=172) of all reported cases) were healthcare workers. \nAnalysis of ongoing chain of transmission\n\nAs of 21 January, the current transmission chain is comprised of 82 confirmed and probable cases reported in 13 health areas in six health zones; Mabalako, Beni, Biena, Butembo, Katwa, and Musienene Health Zones. The transmission chain originated from one individual who was classified as a relapse of EVD in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone (first reported in the Disease Outbreak News published on 19 December 2019). The individual, which is the first and only case of relapse documented in this outbreak, was infected in June 2019, relapsed in November, and passed away in December. \n\nFurther analyses indicate that the individual directly infected 29 people while symptomatic in the community for nine days before being isolated. Of the cases who were directly infected from this case, 11/29 were through possible nosocomial transmission. The remaining 52 cases resulted from onward transmissions. \n\nBased on available information regarding the place of exposure for cases in this transmission chain, the main drivers are individuals exposed in the community due to delays to case isolation (50%, 41/82), possible nosocomial transmission (37%, 30/82), and community deaths where cases were exposed during funerals (2%, 2/82). The estimated reproduction number (R), which is the expected number of secondary cases produced by a single infection in a susceptible population, of this transmission chain was not statistically significantly different from the overall mean R of this outbreak, likely due to the limited sample size of cases in the transmission chain which originated in Aloya Health Area. These findings reinforce the importance of early identification of cases and safe and dignified burials.  \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

All five cases were reported from Beni Health Zone and had epidemiological links to the transmission chain which originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone. The most likely exposure for all these cases was through nosocomial infection in traditional practitioner facilities. All of the cases were identified as contacts but were not followed up at the time of detection. \n\nOne confirmed case reported on 20 January stayed in the community for four days prior to being admitted to an Ebola treatment centre (ETC) and infected two additional people in the community. These two individuals, reported on 27 January, stayed four to five days in the community while symptomatic prior to isolation. One other confirmed case stayed in the community for eight days after symptom onset and passed away in the community on 28 January. Confirmed cases who spend time in the community increase the risk of transmission of EVD to contacts. Therefore, further cases can be expected in the coming two weeks in Bundji and Kanzulinzuli Health Areas and neighbouring health areas in Beni Health Zone. \n\nIn the past 21 days (8 to 28 January 2020), 28 confirmed cases were reported from five health areas within three active health zones in North Kivu Province (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=18), Mabalako (n=9), and Musienene (n=1). Beni Health Zone remains the current hotspot of the outbreak, having reported 64% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days. As of 28 January, the following health zones marked more than 21 days without confirmed cases of EVD: Mambasa Health Zone in Ituri Province (23 days), and Butembo (25 days) Health Zone in North Kivu Province. Of the 28 people confirmed with EVD in the past 21 days, 20 were isolated and provided care within the first two days after symptom onset, which means that they have better chances of survival and are less likely to infect contacts in the community. \n\nIn the past 21 days encouraging trends about the development of the outbreak have been observed. The past epidemiological week (20 to 26 January 2020) saw the smallest number of cases reported since the beginning of the response; cases have been reported in five health areas in three health zones; contact tracing performance as well as the daily number of reported alerts continue to improve over time (Figure 3, Figure 4).  Contact tracing has notably improved as a result of the provision of accommodation and essential services in Beni Health Zone to known contacts who have agreed to be followed. Despite these encouraging signs, continuous vigilance is warranted in order to overcome remaining challenges. Possible nosocomial transmission linked to traditional practitioner facilities remains a major driver of the current outbreak and poses specific challenges such as contact identification. \n\nAs of 28 January, a total of 3421 EVD cases were reported, including 3302 confirmed and 119 probable cases, of which 2242 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1918) were female, 28% (n=963) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=172) of all reported cases were health care workers. \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

All four cases were reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province. Three cases had epidemiological links to the transmission chain which originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone, and their most likely exposure was through nosocomial infection in traditional practitioner facilities. The fourth and most recent case reported in Beni Health Zone was not a known contact at the time of detection, stayed in the community for nine days after symptom onset, and passed away in the community on 4 February. Confirmed cases who spend time in the community increase the risk of transmission of EVD to contacts. \n\nIn the past 21 days (15 January to 4 February January 2020), 18 confirmed cases, including three community deaths, were reported from three health areas within two active health zones in North Kivu Province (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=17) and Mabalako (n=1). The reduction of geographic spread of EVD cases and the declining trend in case incidence observed in the past 21 days are encouraging. In addition, monthly surveillance indicators have overall improved since October 2019. These indicators include an increase in proportion of cases registered as contacts, a decrease in the proportion of community deaths among new reported cases, a decrease in delay to isolation, and a decrease in the monthly case fatality ratio. \n\nThese improvements are fragile and should not be interpreted as an indication that response efforts can be reduced. Among the 18 people confirmed with EVD in the past 21 days, nine cases were isolated and provided care three or more days after symptom onset, which increases the possibility of community transmission. The four most recent cases reported in Beni Health Zone in the past seven days were not under surveillance at the time of detection. Therefore, heightened vigilance of the response is critical, including continued identification of cases and contacts, follow up of contacts, and continuing to improve infection prevention and control in health care facilities.\n\nAs of 4 February, a total of 3429 EVD cases were reported, including 3306 confirmed and 123 probable cases, of which 2251 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1).

From 5 to 11 February, three new confirmed cases were reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province. All three cases have epidemiological links to a transmission chain originating in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone, with possible nosocomial exposure in Beni. The most recent case reported from Beni Health Zone on 11 February was isolated one day after symptom onset. Early detection of cases reduces the probability of transmission of EVD in the community and significantly improves the clinical outcome for the patients.\n\nIn the past 21 days (22 January to 11 February 2020), 12 confirmed cases, including three community deaths, were reported from four health areas within two active health zones in North Kivu Province (Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=11) and Mabalako (n=1). It has been 42 days since Katwa Health Zone has reported new cases. The continued reduction of geographic spread of EVD cases and the declining trend in case incidence observed in the past 21 days are encouraging; however, these improvements remain fragile and should not be interpreted as an indication that response efforts can be reduced. Continued vigilance is essential to improve infection prevention and control in health care facilities, as well as ensuring early identification and follow up of cases and contacts.\n\nAs of 11 February, a total of 3432 EVD cases were reported, including 3309 confirmed and 123 probable cases, of which 2253 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%) (Table 1). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1923) were female, 28% (n=968) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=172) of all reported cases were health care workers. \n\nOn 12 February, the WHO Director-General reconvened the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR). The Committee reviewed progress in the implementation of the Temporary Recommendations issued on 18 October 2019. Updates on the outbreak were provided by representatives of the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the UN Ebola Emergency Response Coordinator and the WHO Secretariat. The situation in neighbouring countries was reviewed, as well as preparedness in nonaffected areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was the view of the Committee that this event still constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Further details can be found in the Emergency Committee Statement. \n\nOn 10 February, WHO published new guidelines for healthcare providers regarding the management of pregnant and breastfeeding women in the context of Ebola virus disease. The document reviews existing evidence and provides a single set of recommendations on the care continuum for women exposed to, diagnosed with, or recovered from Ebola, and will enable healthcare providers, emergency response teams and health policy-makers to improve prevention and treatment measures in an Ebola outbreak. The news release of this guideline can be found here. \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

WHO continuously monitors changes to the epidemiological situation and context of the outbreak to ensure that support to the response is adapted to the evolving circumstances. This assessment acknowledged improvements in case incidence and other epidemiological indicators, and the strengthened local and regional capacities. Dynamics of the outbreak, however, remain contingent upon access for response teams to affected areas. Continued insecurity remains a barrier the outbreak response effort. The limited number of community deaths still occasionally reported among new EVD cases can perpetuate transmission, with potential for new cases to arise outside of groups under surveillance. Ebola virus may persist in some survivors’ body fluids. In a limited number of instances, secondary transmissions from exposure to body fluids of survivors have been documented. We should expect further clusters of cases following exposure to survivors’ infected body fluids in the coming few months. This risk can be mitigated through the dedicated programme for survivor care and monitoring. At both a national and regional level, potential limitations imposed on response and preparedness activities (e.g. shortages of funding, loss of access to communities due to deterioration in security, etc.), could reverse the gains that have been made in controlling the outbreak.\nWHO advice \n\nWHO advises against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available information. Any requirements for certificates of Ebola vaccination are not a reasonable basis for restricting movement across borders or the issuance of visas for travellers to/from the affected countries. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic to and from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practise good hygiene.

From 12 to 18 February, one new confirmed case was reported. The case was reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province and had an epidemiological link to a confirmed case reported on 5 February. As the case was alerted and transferred to an Ebola Treated Centre four days after symptom onset, there remains a risk that onward transmission to contacts may have occurred, and further cases may be expected from the currently active chain of transmission. Ebola virus may also persist in some survivors’ body fluids for several months, and in a limited number of instances, transmissions from exposure to body fluids of survivors have been documented during this outbreak. The ongoing programme for survivor care helps mitigate the risks of re-introduction events.\n\nTo maintain operations and prevent re-emergence of the outbreak, WHO is requesting funding. Under the Strategic Response Plan (SRP 4.1), WHO’s financial need for the Ebola Response from January to June 2020 is US $83 million. Thanks to the generosity of many donors during 2019, WHO has some carry-over funding, which has been applied to maintain operations through February 2020. USD $40 million is currently needed to ensure continuity of response and preparedness activities to bring the case incidence to zero, and continue building strong, resilient health systems. \n\nIn the past 21 days (29 January to 18 February 2020), eight confirmed cases were reported from four health areas within two active health zones in North Kivu Province (Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=7) and Mabalako (n=1).

This was the first time since the beginning of the response that no new confirmed cases were reported over a seven-day period (Figure 1). The most recent case was reported in Beni Health Zone, North Kivu Province on 17 February. While the lack of new confirmed cases reported in the last seven days is a major achievement, the outbreak remains active and risk of additional cases emerging remains high. In the past 21 days (5 to 25 February 2020), four confirmed cases were reported from two health areas in Beni Health Zone in North Kivu Province (Figure 2, Table 1). Even with strengthened surveillance operations, transmission of Ebola virus outside of groups currently under surveillance cannot be excluded. Ebola virus also persists in some survivors’ body fluids, with potential to infect others. In at least one instance during this outbreak, relapse – in which a person who has recovered from EVD develops symptoms again – was observed, sparking a new chain of transmission which has taken several months to interrupt. To mitigate a potential resurgence of the outbreak, it is critical to maintain response capacities to rapidly detect and respond to any new cases, and to prioritize survivor support and monitoring and the maintenance of cooperative relationships with the survivors’ associations.\n\nSubstantial surveillance, pathogen detection, and clinical management activities are currently ongoing, including validating alerts, following remaining contacts who were potentially exposed to the virus, supporting rapid diagnostics of suspected cases, and working with community members to strengthen surveillance on people who pass away in the communities. As of 25 February, 510 contacts are currently under surveillance, of which 97% were followed daily in the last seven days. In the last seven days, more than 5100 alerts per day were reported and investigated, of which over 400 alerts (including ~70 community deaths) were validated as suspected EVD cases; requiring laboratory testing and specialized care within the established Ebola treatment and transit centres. On average, suspect cases stay in these facilities for three days before EVD can be definitively ruled out (i.e. after two negative polymerase chain reaction tests 48 hours apart), while care is provided for their illness under isolation precautions. Timely testing of suspected cases continues to be provided across 11 operational laboratories deployed in cities that have been affected by the outbreak. From 17 to 23 February, more than 3600 samples were tested.\n\nTo maintain operations and prevent potential resurgence of the outbreak, WHO requires further funding.

This is an important milestone in the outbreak. However, there is still a high risk of re-emergence of EVD, and a critical need to maintain response operations – as outlined in the WHO recommended criteria for declaring the end of the EVD outbreak.\n\nAs of 3 March 2020, a total of 3444 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), including 3310 confirmed and 134 probable cases, of which 2264 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1927) were female, 28% (n=973) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers. \n\nWHO’s financial need for the Ebola Response for January to June 2020 (SRP 4.1) is US $83 million. Thanks to the generosity of donors during 2019, WHO had some carry-over funding available, however, WHO now requires US$ 40 million to ensure continuity of activities.\nSurvivors of Ebola virus disease\n\nEbola virus may persist in some survivors’ body fluids, with potential to infect others. In at least one instance during this outbreak, relapse was observed, sparking a new chain of transmission which has taken several months to interrupt. At the individual level, people who have recovered from EVD may develop medical and psychological complications. EVD survivors should be offered support when they return to their communities in order to care for any post-EVD complications. \n\nIn response to these needs, and based on lessons learned from previous outbreaks, a multi-disciplinary follow-up programme for EVD survivor care was initiated just three months after the declaration of the outbreak by the Ministry of Health and the Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale (INRB), with the support of the World Health Organization and the World Food Programme. It was the first time a national EVD survivor programme was implemented in the early phase of an EVD outbreak. \n\nThe programme entails monthly visits to health clinics for at least 18 months to follow up with clinical, biological and psychological aspects of each survivor’s health and well-being. Each month, more than 85% of survivors come to the clinics. This suggests that survivors and their communities accept, trust and have confidence in the programme. In addition, survivors are offered specialized services by trained local professionals, working in close collaboration with survivors’ associations. This includes ophthalmic care, neurological care, psychosocial support, laboratory services, pregnancy management and paediatric care. The programme has continued to adapt with the evolution of the outbreak. Five dedicated clinics are currently operating in Beni, Butembo, Goma, Mangina, and Mambasa. \n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, 1160 people have recovered from EVD. This includes 50 (4%) infants under 1-year-old, 55 (5%) children aged 1 to 4 years old, 145 (13%) children aged 5 to 17, and 910 (78%) adults aged 18 years or older. Of the total survivors, 641 (55%) are female, including eight women that were pregnant at the time of EVD infection, and survived with a viable foetus. To ensure proper pregnancy follow-up and safe delivery, WHO supported the implementation of dedicated care for these women. This is the first time women who were pregnant while sick with EVD have recovered with healthy babies and is a major breakthrough in supporting pregnant women who recovered from EVD.\n\nIn order to provide appropriate and needed care for EVD survivors it is essential to sustain the programme for at least 18 months after the outbreak is declared over. Furthermore, concerted research efforts are required to better understand and respond to survivor needs. WHO will support INRB and partners in these endeavours. \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

Overall, this was a 16% decrease in testing compared to the previous week. \n\nThroughout the outbreak, alert rates steadily climbed as active and passive case finding systems were strengthened, reaching additional health zones with the evolution of the outbreak, and continuously adapted to suit local context. With the decline in confirmed case incidence and gradual transition toward routine disease surveillance systems, alert rates have expectantly begun to decline in some areas. It, however, remains important for appropriate levels of surveillance to be maintained through the end of outbreak declaration to rapidly detect relapse, reintroduction or new emergence events, thereby providing an opportunity to implement effective control measures and avoid a potential resurgence of the outbreak. \n\nAs of 10 March 2020, a total of 3444 EVD cases were reported from 29 health zones (Table 1, Figure 2), including 3310 confirmed and 134 probable cases, of which 2264 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n=1931) were female, 28% (n=975) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=171) were health care workers. \nFigure 1: Confirmed and probable Ebola virus disease cases by week of illness onset by health zone.

The total number of deaths includes the deaths that WHO is aware of to date through follow-up with affected member states.\nWHO risk assessment\n\nInfection with MERS-CoV can cause severe disease resulting in high mortality. Humans are infected with MERS-CoV from direct or indirect contact with dromedaries. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, the observed non-sustained human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. \n\nThe notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to dromedaries, animal products (for example, consumption of camel’s raw milk), or humans (for example, in a health care setting). \n\nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information.\nWHO advice\n\nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nInfection prevention and control measures (IPC) are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV infection early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV infection are non-specific. Therefore, healthcare workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \n\nEarly identification, case management and isolation, together with appropriate infection prevention and control measures can prevent human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV.\r\n\n\nMERS-CoV causes more severe disease in people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and compromised immune systems. Therefore, people with these underlying medical conditions should avoid close unprotected contact with animals, particularly dromedary camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.\r\n\n\nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.\n\nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.", "reports": [{"event_date": "2020-02-24", "locations": [{"country": "Saudi Arabia", "location": "Riyadh, Ar Riyāḑ"}], "diseases": ["mers-cov", "tuberculosis"], "syndromes": ["unknown"]}]}, {"url": "https://www.who.int/csr/don/08-january-2020-mers-uae/en/", "date_of_publication": "2020-01-08Txx:xx:xx", "headline": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) – The United Arab Emirates", "main_text": "On 29 December 2019, the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported one laboratory-confirmed case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to WHO.\n\nThe case is a 74-year-old male national who owns a camel farm located in Al Ain City, Abu Dhabi region in UAE where he is living.
