However, there was an increase in cases reported in WPR, from 11 118 in 2017 to 26 163 cases in 2018. A resurgence of measles cases has been seen in all WHO Regions. An unusually high number of cases reported from countries and areas of the WPR in 2019 have been reported from: 1) several countries/areas where measles has been eliminated due to importation-related outbreaks; and 2) endemic countries such as the Philippines which has ongoing measles outbreak. In WPR, currently nine countries and areas (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Hong Kong SAR (China), Japan, Macao SAR (China), New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore) are verified by the Regional Verification Commission for Measles Elimination as having interrupted endemic measles virus transmission for more than 36 months.\n\nTo date, there have been no measles cases reported from the Pacific Island Countries and areas. The majority of countries and areas in WPR have made positive inroads to improve immunization and achieve higher vaccination coverage at the national level. However, with global resurgence of measles and movement of populations, several countries and areas in WPR remain vulnerable to outbreaks of measles due to low coverage of measles-containing-vaccine (MCV), at the subnational level and among vulnerable populations. \n\nThe following is a brief update on the measles situation in WPR from publicly available or information shared by Member States with WPR\nRegional update\nAustralia\n\nFrom 1 January to 12 April 2019, 97 measles cases have been reported nationwide. So far, the number of reported cases is higher than the number of cases reported for the same time period in the last 4 years. The majority of cases in 2019 were imported from countries that have reported cases or outbreaks of measles including Indonesia, Israel, Myanmar, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. For more information, please see here\nChina\n\nIn 2018, 3 940 confirmed measles cases were reported nationally, and the predominant genotype was H1. Although China reported the second highest number of cases in the region following the Philippines in 2018, relative to the population size, the incidence rate remained low at 2.9 per 1 000 000 persons. In January, February and March of 2019, there were 178, 156 and 267 measles cases reported nationwide, respectively. For more information, please see here and here\nHong Kong SAR, China\n\nHong Kong SAR, China achieved measles elimination in 2016 and the annual reported number of measles cases has remained at a low level in the past few years. As of 11 April 2019, the national cumulative number of measles cases is 66. From 4 March 2019, there has been an airport cluster of 29 measles cases, 27 workers from the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) and two crew members of a local airline. Thirty cases have no obvious epidemiological link identified and the majority have a travel history to; Philippines (8), Mainland China (9, six of which are from Shenzhen, China), Japan (6),Taiwan,China (3), Europe (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and Viet Nam (1). From next year (2020), children aged 18 months will receive the second vaccination instead of having it when they are six years old under the existing policy. For more information, please see here\nMacao SAR, China\n\nAs of 8 April 2019, 32 measles cases have been reported in Macao SAR, China. Of these, 14 are imported cases, and the rest (18) were locally acquired but epidemiologically linked to imported cases. The 18 locally acquired cases include 10 staff from two hospitals. For more information, please see here\nJapan\n\nOn March 2015, the WHO Western Regional Office verified that Japan had achieved measles elimination. However, from 1 January to 3 April 2019, 378 measles cases have been reported in Japan, the highest number of measles cases recorded during the same time period in a decade. Fifty-six (14.8%) cases were among persons with reported travel history to Philippines (23), Viet Nam (13), Myanmar (5), Hong Kong SAR, China (3), Maldives (2), Sri Lanka (1), New Zealand (1) Malaysia (1), Republic of Korea (1) and Ukraine (1), Cambodia (1), Thailand (1), and an additional two cases with travel to both Maldives and Sri Lanka, and one case with travel to both Thailand and Lao PDR. In comparison, a total of 282 measles cases were reported nationally in 2018. In 2019, 65% of cases were among persons aged between 15 to 39 years, and 256 cases (68%) with no or unknown vaccination history. For more information, please see here\nMalaysia \n\nThe Ministry of Health reported that the number of measles cases in Malaysia increased exponentially from 195 cases in 2013 to 1 934 cases in 2018, an increase of almost 900% over a period of 5 years with six deaths related to measles, of which none were immunized. The number of measles cases among unimmunized persons increased from 125 cases (69%) in 2013 to 1 467 cases (76%) in 2018. From 2016 to 2018, WHO data showed the incidence rate for confirmed measles cases in Malaysia ranged from 50 to 60 per 1 000 000 population. For more information, please see here and here\nNew Zealand\n\nFrom 1 January to 10 April 2019, there have been 72 measles cases with three clusters. Canterbury region has the largest number of infections with 39 cases, followed by Auckland region with 16 cases, Waikato with 12 cases, three in Bay of Plenty and two in Southland. The virus isolated from cases in Canterbury was a B3 genotype, similar to a recent strain from the Philippines. A typed cluster in Waikato was linked to cases reported in November 2018 associated with a travel-related case. Two cases in Bay of Plenty were related to travellers returning from the Philippines and another case was in a person who made multiple stops in Japan and Singapore. The majority of cases have occurred in adolescents and young adults aged between 10 to 29 years. In 2018, a total of 30 cases were reported nationally. New Zealand achieved measles elimination in 2017 with a national Immunization coverage of 92% and 89% for first and second dose of measles-containing vaccine, respectively, in 2016. For more information, please see here\nThe Philippines\n\nThe Philippines experienced an increase in measles cases from late 2017. In February 2019, the Department of Health (DoH) officially declared a measles outbreak in five regions: National Capital Region (NCR) (which is Metro Manila), Regions IVA, III, VI and VII. While an outbreak was declared in five regions, measles cases were reported from all regions. Nationally, from 1 January to 30 March 2019, there have been 25 956 measles cases including 381 deaths reported (case fatality rate (CFR)= 1.5%), an increase by 378% compared to the same time period in 2018. From 1 January to 30 March 2019, NCR recorded the highest number of measles cases with 5 586 including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%) followed by region IVA with 5 281 cases including 104 deaths (CFR= 2%). The majority of measles cases were among persons who were unvaccinated (59%) and under five years of age (53%). The Philippines has had persistent low immunization coverage over the past few years, from above 80% in 2008 to below 70% in 2017. According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 2.6 million Filipino children under the age of 5 years are not protected from measles, with 80% coming from 7 out of 17 regions. Chronic low routine immunization coverage and vaccination hesitancy is broadly agreed as the root cause for this outbreak. For more information, please see here\nRepublic of Korea\n\nFrom 17 December 2018 to 22 April 2019, 150 measles cases have been reported, including eight clusters associated with imported cases. Confirmed cases with recent overseas travel visited the following countries: Viet Nam (16), Philippines (10), Thailand (2), Ukraine (2), Europe (1), Taiwan, China (1), Madagascar (1), Cambodia (1), Uzbekistan (1) and Kyrgyzstan (1).
