# Map that shows diseases over time
Already done - leave to me Richard
Needs fine tuning

# Map that you can simulate the spread of coronavirus


# Coronavirus Avoider
- A map of Australia shows all suburbs which have cases and the amount of cases (probably a stronger colour for more cases?)
- Have an algorithm which will find the path between 2 locations which will ensure the user is least exposed to the virus
- This path algorithm will be mainly for walking & public transport or specifically for that
- This map then also shows the hot spots that an infected user may have inputted

# Infected Users System
- create a login/sign up page
- save all user data to firestore (name/home address/age/gender/email address/phone number?)
- user can pinpoint locations they went to on a map -> probably save the lat/long or point?
- actually create a email "AusGovCOVIDChecker@gmail" or something which will email the users -> so like actually have it email the user on sign up 

So areas the user has recently been to or goes to will be known as hot spots (will stay active as an infected area for 3 days)
